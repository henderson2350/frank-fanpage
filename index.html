    <p class="whiteText">
        Frank Ocean was born in New Orleans, n√© Christopher Breaux. He gained
        recognition for his participation in the group Odd Future, and eventually
        launched his solo career with his first mixtape, Nostalgia Ultra. He 
        has since released two studio albums along with several singles.

        Frank Ocean is the greatest artist of our generation. His lyricsim
        is unmatched. Even though he rarely comes out with music and even
        less often performs, he delivers every time.
